# Task 2 – Music Class Registration Webpage

**Task Level:** Intermediate  
**Internship:** ApexPlanet Web Development Internship  

This repository contains my **Task 2 (Intermediate Level)** project for the ApexPlanet Web Development Internship.  
The objective of this task was to build an interactive and enhanced webpage using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

In this project, I created a **Music Class Registration webpage** featuring:
- 🎸 Instrument image gallery with about info  
- 💰 Dynamic fee display based on selected instrument  
- ⏰ Time slot selection based on preferred schedule  
- ✅ Form validation for user inputs (name, email, mobile, instrument, schedule, time slot)  
- 🎉 Personalized success summary displayed after form submission  

This project demonstrates my ability to apply intermediate-level web development concepts, enhance interactivity, and deliver a clean, user-friendly design.
